* What we thought went well:
Our overall collaboration as a team was something we were very proud of in the long run. Every team member was very open minded, communicative, and understanding. We succeeded at ensuring we ran the project in a democratic way, so that everyone had a say in our final decisions during the execution of our plans. No single team member took full control, or let their egos get the best of them. All team members practiced phenomenal servant leadership and took everyone's thoughts and opinions into full consideration before making final decisions; we were each able to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances that we were approached with.


* Lessons learned/What we would do differently
Looking back on our execution of this project, the primary things we would do differently are understanding when we should abandon a certain course of action. We found ourselves stuck on deployment and kept claiming we were so close to coming up with a solid solution to the problem. This caused us to spend a significant amount of time on a portion of the project that we ended up having to scrap in the long run anyway. Our reasoning for scrapping the deployment aspect of our project was because we lost pieces of functionality once we successfully got our project deployed; looking back, if we were to scrap that aspect of the project in a more timely fashion, we would have persevered with our user stories more-so than we were able to in the end. Another thing we would work on is how we approached the solution to our user stories; rather than trying to assume what the product owner meant or wanted from the acceptance criteria, we would seek out further clarification and take a much more simplistic approach to solving those problems. Lastly, we would make the cohesion of the update product button a bit more clear by adding "add quantity" somewhere in the card to distinguish that the update product button would only change the stock quantity stored in the database.

* Improvements moving forward
Given more time to complete the project, we would take into consideration everything we have identified in our lessons learned section of this retrospective and take a more simplistic approach to solving our user stories. We would focus more on cohesion of code and clarity of the user interface to ensure there is no confusion from a user perspective on how to navigate the application. 

Being together a week gave us a chance to begin to solidify our team into an agile and cohesive working unit. In the beginning we spent time learning about both each other and the agile process, but by the end of our second user story, we really began to click. The lessons we learned as we progressed had a significant impact on future decisions, and given more time, we believe we would have been able to accomplish so much more, as we continue to learn and grow together.
